Example:
Hello World Die\n
Bye World

1. Reads one line (may contain starting part of 2nd line if buffer is beyond 1st line's \n)
-- Hello World Die\nB\0
2. Get that 1st line without chars after \n aka 2nd line characters and return it
-- Hello World Die\n\0
3. Update the line to haves only the chars after \n aka 2nd line characters
-- B\0
4. When function is called again, the static char is already updated with the 2nd line characters
-- B\0
5. cycle repeats until read function reads whatever bytes are left and have the final strjoin
-- rld\0 (read = 3) then get that line , then update line to null
